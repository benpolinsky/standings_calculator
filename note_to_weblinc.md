# Hi.

In the interest of honesty:

I didn't initialize a git repo from the start as I was just meaning to do some initial work, and then start again.  
However, I kept going, thus the late initial commit.  I'd be happy to show you my first, unrefactored crack at the problem,
and let you know where I stumbled briefly.

I also didn't begin with tests, no TDD, but brought them in once I had a semi-working solution.

Oh, I also thought the excercise was to output the standings to a file.  Then I re-read the instructions and realized console output
was requested.  Just FYI.
